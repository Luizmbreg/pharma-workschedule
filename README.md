Pharma Work Schedule

This project is a simple tool to validate and calculate work schedules for pharmacists in a retail pharmacy. It checks full store coverage, calculates weekly work hours, and points out errors in the schedule. The logic follows common rules used in Brazilian pharmacy operations, including breaks, return times, multiple professionals, and daily store hours. The HTML structure was designed to be easily transferable between internal teams and departments, without requiring external dependencies or installations. This helps avoid conflicts with common corporate security policies, since the tool runs locally and does not rely on external services, frameworks, or network access.

This project validates:

- Store opening hours for each day.

- Pharmacist schedules (Entry/Break/Return/Exit) for up to 6 pharmacists.

- Validating full coverage of the store’s operating hours.

- Breaks longer than 2 hours.

- Shifts outside store opening hours.

- Lack of coverage.

- Missing required fields.

- Displaying the total weekly hours.

To run, open it in a web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.).

No installation needed, it runs locally. Everything is inside a single HTML file: HTML interface, Simple CSS, JavaScript and validation logic

Works both locally and through GitHub Pages.
